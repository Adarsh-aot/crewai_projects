**Song Title:** "Reflections in the Mirror"

**Verse 1:**
I see the world through a broken lens
A reflection of the truth, we pretend
Systemic racism, a disease that never ends
We're still fighting for equality, my friend
From Martin to Malcolm, the struggle's still real
We're still screaming for justice, but the system's still sealed
Police brutality, a never-ending plight
We're still dying in the streets, day and night

**Chorus:**
Reflections in the mirror, staring back at me
A world that's broken, can't you see?
We're searching for a change, a glimmer of hope
But the system's designed to keep us in a scope

**Verse 2:**
Mental health, a silent killer in our midst
We're afraid to speak, afraid to resist
The stigma's real, the pain's real too
We're losing ourselves, in a world that's not true
Self-care's a luxury, we can't afford
We're drowning in our thoughts, in a world that's ignored
The wealth gap's growing, the poor get poorer still
We're living in a world, where the system's unfulfilled

**Chorus:**
Reflections in the mirror, staring back at me
A world that's broken, can't you see?
We're searching for a change, a glimmer of hope
But the system's designed to keep us in a scope

**Verse 3:**
Social media, a double-edged sword
A platform for change, or a tool to be ignored
We're lost in the noise, in a digital haze
We're searching for connection, in a world of digital daze
We're slaves to the algorithm, our thoughts are for sale
We're living in a world, where the truth's often failed
We're searching for a voice, in a world that's gone mad
We're searching for a change, before we're all so sad

**Chorus:**
Reflections in the mirror, staring back at me
A world that's broken, can't you see?
We're searching for a change, a glimmer of hope
But the system's designed to keep us in a scope

**Outro:**
Reflections in the mirror, staring back at me
A world that's broken, can't you see?
We're searching for a change, a glimmer of hope
But the system's designed to keep us in a scope
